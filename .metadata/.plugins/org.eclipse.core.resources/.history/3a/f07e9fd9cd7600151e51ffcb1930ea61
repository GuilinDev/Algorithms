	/*
	 * Given an array S of n integers, find three integers in S such that the sum is closest to a given number, target. Return the sum of the three integers. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.

    	For example, given array S = {-1 2 1 -4}, and target = 1.

    	The sum that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2).

	// Otherwise, check if | a + b + c - target | is smaller, update closest (track the closest sum) to the current sum.
